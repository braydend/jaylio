# Test List

A collection of test cases I think of as I develop the Jaylio API. 

Inspired by the method showcased in Kent Beck's Test Driven Development: By Example, I thought I'd give it a try

- [ ] can parse CSV to JSON
- [ ] can parse CSV with no activities to JSON
- [ ] can parse CSV with note to JSON
- [x] can serialise JSON to string
- [x] can serialise JSON without activities to string
- [x] can serialise JSON with note to string
