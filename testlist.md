# Test List

A collection of test cases I think of as I develop the Jaylio API. 

Inspired by the method showcased in Kent Beck's Test Driven Development: By Example, I thought I'd give it a try

- [x] can parse CSV to Model
- [x] can parse CSV to Model with am or pm time
- [x] can parse CSV with no activities to Model
- [x] can parse CSV with note to Model
- [x] can serialise Model to string
- [x] can serialise Model without activities to string
- [x] can serialise Model with note to string
